rust implementation of pki (public key infrastructure); educational purpose

## Goal
- minimal dependency. implement all logic from first principle
- clean and minimum code, focus on core algorithm

## Plans
- x.509 cert generation
- public / private key pair generation (RSA/ECC?)
  - generate pub key from pri key
- cert signing request (CSR) handling
- cert authority functionality
- basic cert validation logic
